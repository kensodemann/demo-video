# demo-video
Demonstrate using video in the HTML (tab 1) and via plugin (tab 2)

## HTML (Tab 1)

See the MDN docs for details. The code base basically ripped from there anyhow:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video

## Native Plugins

Two are required because the landscape is weird and there is not one that supports both Android and iOS (at least that shows
up in searches).

iOS: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-hkvideoplayer

Android: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/video-player
